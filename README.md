# student grade generator
My grade generator project is a program that initially grades marks.

# Speed Detector project

The project simply takes an input of the speeds car, If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”.
 Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), 
 it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, 
the function should print: “License suspended”.




# Net Salary Calculator
This project calculates an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits, 
then calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.
